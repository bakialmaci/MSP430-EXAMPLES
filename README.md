# Overview

This repository provides examples and documentation related to Texas Instruments MSP430 microcontrollers and launchpads. The examples were developed for educational purposes as part of an embedded system design course, and therefore, may not be optimized for practical use. If you plan to utilize this repository, itâ€™s recommended to focus on understanding the concepts for your studies rather than applying them directly to professional projects.
